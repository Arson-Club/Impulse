# Contributing

We are happy to accept contributions from people with all levels of experience. If you have a feature you would
like to see, or a bug you would like fix, feel free tp open an PR. If you are new to the project take a look at our
issues tagged
with [good first issue](https://github.com/Arson-Club/Impulse/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

Beyond that there are a few guidelines we would like you to follow:

- If it is a particularly large feature, please open an issue first so we can discuss the implementation.
- Make sure you cover your contributions with tests as much as possible
- Once approved to run, make sure your code passes all tests and linters
